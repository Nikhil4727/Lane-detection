Abstract—Identifying lanes is an integral aspect of autonomous
driving, which involves a road scene’s effective feature extraction.
Therefore, in this paper, a performance comparison of the
different CNN models targeting lane detection tasks including,
but not exclusive to, ResNet-101, ResNet-50, ResNet-34, VGG-16, and VGG-19 is presented. The ResNet family of models
performs well due to the residual connections, enabling better
feature-extracting capability at greater depths. At the same time,
spatial detail capture is the strong point of the VGG family of
networks, but at a higher cost in processing power. In addition,
the potential of XGBoost to boost lane detection performance
while using features extracted from a CNN is investigated. This
analysis shows the performance and efficiency trade-offs that
exist and assists in determining the best models that can be
integrated into autonomous driving systems.
